## Description

A user-friendly application designed to streamline the experience for both vendors and customers at farmersâ€™ markets. The application empowers vendors to update their profiles with a bio description of their farms and add pictures and descriptions of their produce to their inventory. And customers can use HarvestHero to effortlessly locate vendors, view payment options, and explore the fresh produce available.

## Getting Started

Ensure you are using npx create react app

### Prerequisites

React, Redux, Express, Multer, Sweetalert2, MUI, Axios

### Installation

To get the project up and running, install the prerequisites. 

## Usage

When a vendor registers, they must select an Account Type of "vendor" to have the appropriate features needed on their profiles. After a vendor logs in or registers, they will be able to add a bio description about themselves, their stall number, and the payment options they accept. Vendors will also have the ability to click 'Add New Item' on the lower right corner, to add items to their inventory.

When customers log in, they will have the ability to search for items that are available at the farmers' market which are entered by vendors. The shopping cart page is currently a static file, along with all 'Add to Cart' buttons.
